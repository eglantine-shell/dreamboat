以下是感恩节经典重温（？）：

衷心感謝X先生，他是我疲憊生活中的英雄夢想，是我對這個遼闊的人世所有好奇與愛的起源。我常常將他比作月亮，有時明朗，有時看不見，但永遠都在那裡，感謝他在這十四年間照著我的凡心。

His love has been a constant anchor in times of stress and uncertainty. I appreciate his attendance in my life as the source of inspiration and stimulation and the origin of passion and motivation. I appreciate him for being here, for being the best partner, and for everything.
